- Hi, Iâ€™m @GIridar1908
- My day job is a grad student who works on the overlap of microfluidics, soft condensed matter, acoustics and electrokinetics. 
- I also have an inexplicable fascination with the N-vector model of statistical mechanics which is a generalization of the Ising, XY and Heisenberg models.
