- Hi, Iâ€™m @GIridar1908
- My day job is a grad student who works on the overlap of microfluidics, soft condensed matter, acoustics and electrokinetics. 
- One day I hope to apply these tools towards the fighting ecological destruction.
- I also have an inexplicable fascination with the N-vector model of statistical mechanics which is a generalization of the Ising, XY and Heisenberg models. 
- One day I plan to make a videogome of sorts that uses these N-vector lattice models. Let me know if you want to work together. Peace!
